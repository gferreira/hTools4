EZUI notes
==========

- ColorWell is not supported?                                               --> SOLVED [Discord] not included in docs

- how to make items as wide as container (100%) (centered buttons)          --> SOLVED [Discord] width='fill'

- adjusting vertical whitespace to group items
- LabelTextFieldAndStepper
- horizontal radio buttons
- horizontal checkboxes

escape characters

Table needs a height otherwise it's not displayed (not in the Docs)

DOCS: all items on a single page is too much (I prefer one item per page like vanilla)

reduce lineHeight and margins of ezui.Table (like I did with List2)

list of all {{icons}} available and their names?
